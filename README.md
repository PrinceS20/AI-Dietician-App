# AI-Dietician-App

Python | Machine Learning | Flask | HTML/CSS | Web Deployment 

During my 5th semester, I designed and developed an AI-based Dietician Web App aimed at promoting healthier eating habits through personalized dietary recommendations. The goal was to simulate the role of a virtual dietician by analyzing user data and suggesting suitable meal plans.

‚ú® Key Features:

User-friendly interface to collect input such as age, gender, height, weight, activity level, dietary goal (weight loss/gain/maintenance), and food preferences (veg/non-veg/vegan).

Backend built using Python with logic to calculate BMI, caloric needs, and macronutrient breakdown.

Incorporated a rule-based system with basic AI logic to match user profiles with appropriate diets (e.g., high protein for muscle gain, low carb for weight loss).

Meal suggestions were categorized by time (breakfast/lunch/dinner/snacks) and showed caloric value and food items.

Used Flask framework to serve the app with an intuitive web interface built using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.

Hosted the application live using 000webhost for public access and demonstration.

üß† What I Learned:

Applied theoretical knowledge of machine learning, nutrition, and full-stack development to a real-world problem.

Learned how to structure a Python-based web app, handle form data, and manage user interactions.

Understood basic hosting and deployment challenges through 000webhost, and gained insight into the importance of selecting reliable deployment platforms.

üåê Status:
The app was successfully deployed and accessible online, but was later shut down due to platform limitations. 

This project helped me bridge the gap between classroom learning and real-world application by combining health tech, web development, and AI in a practical, user-centric tool.
